# introduction_page

- This project was created for the easy of use example of the introduction page, which is shown when an application is opened for the first time.
- Since it will be displayed only once, a bool value had to be registered to the device. [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) could be used for this purpose, but used hive (because I like it).
- The introduction screen codes were taken from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG2WNlQfqyc).
- Designed to be easy to pick up and use :)
